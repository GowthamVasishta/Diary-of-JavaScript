# Comments

comments help readers or future developers to understand your code. Comments of a code describes about the nature or process of your logic flow. The JavaScript interpreter ignores the comments. They are two types of comments.

* single line comment
* Multi line comment

### Single line comment 

Single line comments are represented by `'//'` . For example

    // this is single line comment
    
### Multi line comment

Multi line comments span over multiple lines. They are represented by `/* . . .  */ `, for example

    /* 
       This is a multi line comment, and 
       this are ignored by the interpreter
    */
    
**Note :** Its a good practise to comment your code !
